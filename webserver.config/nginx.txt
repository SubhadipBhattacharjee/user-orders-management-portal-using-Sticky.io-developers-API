For "nginx" the default configuration file is "nginx.conf". You can find this file into either of these locations

1. "/etc/nginx/sites-available/default"
2. "etc/nginx"
3. "usr/local/nginx/conf"
4. "/usr/local/etc/nginx"


In order to redirect all the request coming to the server into the "index.php"(basic routing file) locate the desired file and change the configuration like this.

START>>>

server {
    listen 80;
    server_name example.com;
    root /path/to/your/project;
    index index.php;

    location / {
        try_files $uri $uri/ /index.php?$query_string;
    }

    location ~ \.php$ {
        include fastcgi_params;
        fastcgi_pass unix:/run/php/php-fpm.sock; # Adjust for your setup
        fastcgi_index index.php;
        fastcgi_param SCRIPT_FILENAME $document_root$fastcgi_script_name;
    }
}

END>>>

Explanation
============
1. The "try_files" directive tells the server that for any request to the URI that matches the block in the location, try the "$uri (or $uri/)" first, and if the file is present, serve the file. Otherwise, the fallback option (index.php) is used. And this last behavior is what we want.

2. The fastcgi_pass line should match your PHP-FPM configuration.
